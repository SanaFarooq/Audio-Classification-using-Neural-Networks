# Audio-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
The aforementioned assignment involves implementing neural networks using three different
frameworks: Scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch for classifying the MNIST audio dataset based
on extracted MFCC features.
1. Feature Extraction
Scikit-learn
Advantages:
● Various tools for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
● Simplifies the implementation of neural networks using MLPClassifier.
Disadvantages:
● Limited flexibility in customizing neural network architectures.
● Can be slower for large datasets or complex models compared to other frameworks
like Keras or PyTorch.
2. Keras
Advantages:
● User-friendly and high-level API for building neural networks.
● Offers a wide range of pre-built layers, activation functions, optimizers, etc.
● Good performance and flexibility for designing complex architectures.
Disadvantages:
● Might be less efficient than PyTorch for certain specific use cases due to
computational overhead.
● Debugging can be challenging with less transparent error messages compared to
PyTorch.
3. PyTorch
Advantages:
● Provides a dynamic computational graph and better flexibility for complex
architectures.

● Efficient handling of large datasets and allows seamless integration with GPU
computation.
● Better flexibility and extensibility.
Disadvantages:
● Slightly steeper learning curve, especially for beginners.
● Definition required of each computational step, which might lead to longer code
compared to Keras.
**Final Takeaway
**
For small datasets, use Scikit-learn for its simplicity. Choose Keras for medium-sized datasets
due to its user-friendly interface and decent performance. For larger datasets or complex
customizations, PyTorch is best due to its flexibility and efficient handling of computational
tasks.
**Purpose of Pytorch**
In PyTorch, a data loader is a utility that helps in efficiently loading and managing datasets,
especially when working with large amounts of data for machine learning tasks. Its primary
purpose is to:
Data loaders are crucial for machine learning tasks, managing data from various sources and
preparing it for training or inference. They handle batching efficiently, dividing data into
smaller portions for optimized hardware use and memory efficiency.
Additionally, they facilitate shuffling and sampling to prevent biases and offer diverse data
perspectives. PyTorch's loaders stand out with parallel loading, utilizing multiple CPU cores,
especially beneficial for large datasets.
They seamlessly integrate with PyTorch models, allowing smooth data flow during training
or inference. Their flexibility permits customization with transformations, preprocessing, and
tailored loading for specific needs like normalization and data augmentation.
